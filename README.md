This is a repository for ID Assignment 2.

Website

The name of this website is called "VidList". "Vid" stands for Video and "List" stands for playlist.
Together, "VidList" stands for a playlist of videos.

Overview

This project is to create and design a website for music lovers and users who are interested in researching for relevant videos to the keywords that they desire to be answered. This website serves as a platform for the music lovers and users of the above trait mentioned to search for their desired videos and view the relevant details of the channel that published these videos. 


Design Process

During the designing of the website, my motive of creating this website is to provide a platform for users who wants to watch videos and listen to music of their likings by simply searching up for the relevant keywords. Besides the videos, I want to provide them some description of the videos and a link to the channels that published these videos to let users have a better understanding of the videos and be able to watch related videos in the channel of the video that the users are interested in.

As a user who wants to search for videos, they are able to search for their desired videos.

As a user who wants to know more details of videos that they have watched, they are able to find these videos in the link to the videos'channel.

Wireframes

The wireframe of the website can be found in the link below or the attached Adobe XD files.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.


Testing

Youtube API:
Try to send more than 10,000 queries of the website and verify that the website will not be able load anymore.
This is because one Youtube API key can only used for a maximum of 10,000 queries, once exceed that number, the old Youtube API key must be replaced by a new one in order for the website to function or load.
