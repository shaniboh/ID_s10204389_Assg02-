VidList
This project is one that allow users to search their desired videos as well as to create their own playlist. 


Design Process
I wanted to create this website for users who wants to watch and listen to videos of their likings by simply searching up for related words of the videos. Also to have a playlist of the videos that they have watched which makes the website unique for every individuals.

As a user who wants to search for videos, they are able to search for their desired videos.

As a user who wants to have a copy of the videos they watched, they are able to find these videos in the playlist feature.

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
